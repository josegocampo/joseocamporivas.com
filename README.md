Hi, my name is Jose Ocampo, you found the repo for [my personal website](https://www.joseocampo.org/), here I include all things related to me, my essays, newsletter,  courses, information about me and my latest projects.  

I built this site with a lot of love, everything made from the ground up, even my portrait I made myself with [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), a pixel art tool. My favorite part is how I constructed the essay's template ([example here](https://www.joseocampo.org/conway)) which I styled to have a friendly to read look that resembles Medium a little bit but that it also has one of my favorite Kindle features, which is being able to change colors of the background and text to your liking.

So far I only have the spanish version ready, so if you dont speak spanish I would suggest just hopping trough the pages to get a glimpse of my beatiful site. Working on translation to have the english version functional soon, so that users will be able to swap between their preference.
