         <Tutto className="about">
              <p>
                My name is Jose Ocampo, I am from Chile. I am a Full Stack Software Developer, a Lawyer and a former Online Poker Pro Player.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                I am looking to participate in proyects that: 
                <ol>
                 
                <li>Are interesting to me. - subjective, but maybe you can get an idea for what this means after browswing trough my site a bit-</li> 
                <li>Look to improve the quality of life of a large group of people.</li>
                 <li>Usually proyects that are in the early to mid early stages, love being involved with the development of things..</li> 
                 <li>Incentive curiosity and are opportunities to learn.</li> 
                 <li>Value to participants involved and reward them appropiately to their contributions.</li>

                  </ol>
              </p>

              <p>Programming is what allows me to come the closest and with most efficiency to those purposes, so that is the main tool I use today, 
                but that is only one side of me, I am also a trained lawyer, a probabilistic thinker, good at design and drawing, I think of myself more as a 
                Full Stack problem solver and like to be involved in many different areas.
                 </p>

                 <p>I guess that is why I have a preference for Startups and early stage projects usually, because I can use my full range of skills 
                   and take advantage of my creativity to the fullest.
                 </p>


              <p>My main hobbies are reading, playing sports (golf, soccer, tennis), building apps, cooking, and spending time with friends and family.</p>


              <p>
                My email is joseor@hey.com. I love reading from people all over the internet and even if It might take some time I respond to every single email, 
                would love to hear about you and what you are doing. 
              </p>
