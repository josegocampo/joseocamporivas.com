          <p>
            My name is Jose Ocampo, I am a Full Stack Software Developer, a Lawyer and a former
            Online Poker Pro Player.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am looking to participate in proyects that:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li />
              Are interesting (subjective, but maybe you can get an idea for what this means after
              browswing trough my site a bit).
              <li />
              Look to improve the quality of life of a large group of people.
              <li />
              Usually prefer proyects that are in the early to mid early stages, love being involved
              with the development and planning of things.
              <li />
              Incentivize curiosity and give opportunities to learn.
              <li />
              Value to participants involved and reward them appropiately on their contributions.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            Programming is what allows me today to come closest to those purposes, so that is the
            main tool I use, but that is only one side of me, I am also a lawyer, a probabilistic
            thinker, good at design and drawing, great at researching. I think of myself more as a
            Full Stack problem solver and like to be involved in many different areas.
          </p>

          <p>
            I guess that is why I have a preference for Startups and early stage projects, because I
            can use my full range of skills and take advantage of my creativity to the fullest.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main hobbies are building apps, reading, playing sports (golf, soccer, tennis),
            cooking from scratch (specially pizza, ramen and indian cuisine), and spending time with
            friends and family.

            I love reading from people all over the internet. I respond to every personal email,
            even if sometimes it might take some time. I would love to hear about you and what you
            are doing.
